I couldn't find any comprehensive information on "tavily." Tavily could be a misspelling or a term that is not commonly used. It may also be a proper noun or a private business/organization that doesn't have an extensive online presence. 

However, I made a guess that you might have been looking for the word "travel" or perhaps a term associated with the word "taveli" - a rare or obsolete term for "traveler". I couldn't find information about a word called "tavily."
